    <p id="tribute-info">He was born and raised in <u>Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu</u> and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation <u>(DRDO)</u> and Indian Space Research Organisation <strong>(ISRO)</strong> and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in <strong>1998</strong>, the first since the original nuclear test by India in <strong>1974.</strong></p>
    <p>Kalam was elected as the <u>11th President of India in 2002</u> with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the <strong>Bharat Ratna</strong>, India's highest civilian honour.</p>
<p>While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on <u>27 July 2015, aged 83.</u> Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.[8]</p>
